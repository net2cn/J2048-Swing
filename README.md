Classic old 2048 game. Ahhh I really missed those good ol' days playing 2048 on my TI graphing calculator.

## Build

Make sure you have maven installed in your system. After that all you need to do is to open a terminal and run
```
mvn clean compile assembly:single
```
In your command prompt in the root directory of this repository, and you'll get your jar executable in target directory.
